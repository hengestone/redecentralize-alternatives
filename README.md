# Redecentralize-alternatives
Collect pointers to decentralized alternatives to Github, Slack etc.

## Motivation
A large number of online systems that are foundational to modern internet companies are becoming less desirable for large and small businesses around the world because of cost as they scale up, or legal requirements by authoritarian regimes.

For the purpose of this list self-hosted alternatives will be glossed over, with the focus on Serverless/P2P systems that promote privacy and avoids centralization and authoritarian control.
